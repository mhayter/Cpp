//Not the fastest :( one of my failures at the moment fastest 0.460s
//My answer is 5x slower yikes only can think of bit-trie as possible speedup ...


//2.620s after expoiting repetitions
//2.760s no clear for testCases;
//2.430s % big prime
//6.230s double map
//2.370s htable with vector
//2.320s radix_sort + negative bit transformation up - low
//2.670s conditonal early exit up - low
//2.650s std::sort + upper_bound - lower_bound

//3.950s remove if statement 
//3.380s reserve map
//5.02s -> 4.820s  int works despite wrong
